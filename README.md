# Pawns Paint! Restored

Pawns Paint! Restored is a variation/continuation of the amazing Pawns Paint! by WillieLambo. When Willie was unable to continue updating it, I really missed it in my games so I made a version for my own personal use. After getting Wille's approval, I'm now sharing it on the Workshop for all to enjoy!

The only difference between my version and Willie's (other than updating for B18) is that I changed the paintings to be all real-life public domain paintings.

## Don't like the paintings? Or want to add/remove some?
You can change them! First go to the following location on your hard drive:
<Steam installation location>\SteamApps\workshop\content\294100\1380798383\Textures\Things\Building\Art

There are templates made with paint.net and Photoshop in this folder. All of the paintings that get loaded into a game are located in the "Painting" folder, so you can add or remove them in there.

If you want Wille's paintings back, change the "Painting" folder to "New Painting" and the "Old Painting" folder to "Painting".

## Possible future features
* Rotatable easels and paintings
* Wall-mounted paintings
* Larger paintings
* ~~World peace~~
